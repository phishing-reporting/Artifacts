# Artifacts

The repository contains the results of two experiments:

1. A document entitled “SearchTerms_StudyI.pdf”  shows the search terms used by participants when reporting phishing attacks according to a randomly generated scenario in Study I. 
2. This file, “ParticipantsAnswers_StudyII.csv”, contains the participants' answers in Study II. We provide only critical and anonymised answers to protect participants' privacy as well as the reputations of companies.
